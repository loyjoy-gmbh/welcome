## External link

Direct your customers to an external website with a link.

**Enter URL** - Add here the URL for the external link.     
**Trigger event** - You have the chance to trigger an event when the customer clicks on the link. Therefore you need the 'event' process brick.     
**Title** - Add a title that will be shown under the link.     
**Variable** - An alternative is to add process variable in which the URL is stored.

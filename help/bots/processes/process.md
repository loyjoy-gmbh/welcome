#### The Chat Flow Editor

Let's dive right into the Process Editor, the heart of every chat flow. On the left side, you can find [all process blocks](https://github.com/loyjoy/welcome/blob/master/documentation/process_building_blocks/PROCESS_BUILDING_BLOCKS.md) to use for your chat flow. 

Simply **drag and drop** the process blocks into your flow. 

Once you have added all your process blocks, the next step would be editing. Click "Close process editor" to open the Chat Flow Editor.

Now you can adjust the different process blocks. Feel free to insert your prefered text into the text fields. Click on each process block to edit its texts. 

If you want to try out what you have built up so far. Hit "Refresh Preview" and open the chat window by clicking on the chat bubble at the bottom. Your chatbot will open and you can check out your progress. Whenever you wish to restart the flow, simply press "Refresh Preview" again.


Do not worry about saving your progress. We have your back! **Every edit is automatically saved.**


##### Tips & Tricks

To **add hyperlinks, emojis and variables** to your texts, click on the small button at the end of each text field.

1. Hyperlinks: Adding a hyperlink to your text will require a link text (in square brackets) and an URL link (in round brackets).

2. Select exciting emoticons to engage emotionally with your consumers. Take advantage of our selection, where all emoticons are checked for aesthetics on all operating systems. But you are not limited - Insert any emoji by simply pasting it into the text field.

3. Add variables to individualize your texts for every customer. Address them by their first name when returning to your chatbot, provide content-specific data or link variable data to your text field. 

In the lower right corner of the process blocks you will find three icons to name, copy and condition your process modules:

To make sure you stay on top of your chat flow, you can **name your process blocks** according to their use by clicking in the three dots on the lower right corner of your process block. This helps you to navigate through your flow when complexity grows.

You can also **copy process modules** by clicking on the Copy symbol. You can paste a process module by re-opening the Process Editor by clicking the three dots in the upper right corner.

If you want to add process module **conditions**, please press the circle in the lower right corner of the blocks. You can now add and adjust conditions under which the process module should be executed.

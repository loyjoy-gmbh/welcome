#### The Chat Flow Editor

Let's dive right into the Process Editor, the heart of every chat flow. On the left side, you can find [all process blocks](https://github.com/loyjoy/welcome/blob/master/documentation/process_building_blocks/PROCESS_BUILDING_BLOCKS.md) to use for your chat flow.

</p>

Simply drag and drop the process blocks into your flow.

</p>

Once you have added all your process blocks, the next step would be editing. Click "Close process editor" to open the Chat Flow Editor.

</p>

Feel free to insert your prefered text into the text fields. Click on each process block to edit its texts.

</p>

To add hyperlinks, emojis and variables to your texts, click on the small button at the end of each text field.

</p>

Adding a hyperlink to your text will require a link text (in square brackets) and an URL link (in round brackets).

<p align="center">
   <img src="link_example.png" alt="Example of using links" title="Example of using links" width="500"/>
</p>

This is how a hyperlink looks like for the user.

</p>

Select exciting emoticons to engage emotionally with your consumers. Take advantage of our selection, where all emoticons are checked for aesthetics on all operating systems. But you are not limited - Insert any emoji by simply pasting it into the text field.

</p>

Add variables to individualize your texts for every customer. Address them by their first name when returning to your chatbot, provide content-specific data or link variable data to your text field.

</p>

To make sure you stay on top of your chat flow, you can name your process blocks according to their use. This helps you to navigate through your flow when complexity grows.

<p align="center">
  <img src="name_bricks.png" alt="Give bricks a name" title="Give bricks a name" width="300"/>
</p>

Now it is time to try out what you have built up so far. Hit "Refresh Preview" and open the chat window by clicking on the chat bubble at the bottom. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="refresh_preview.png" alt="Refresh preview" title="Refresh preivew" width="400"/>
  <img src="button.png" alt="Chatbutton" title="Chatbutton" width="50"/>
</p>

Your chatbot will open and you can check out your progress. Whenever you wish to restart the flow, simply press "Refresh Preview" again.

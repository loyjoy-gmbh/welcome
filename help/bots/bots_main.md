## Bots - Overview
On this page you will find everything about the chat bots. A chatbot has at least one experience, e.g. a Giveaway or an Advent calendar or an individual one. In this overview you can see all experiences of your bot. 

- By clicking on an experience, you can open it and edit it. 
- By clicking on the name of the bot, you can edit and adjust several general features of your bot and your experiences.
- At the top of the page you can choose between your bots.

### How to set up your experience:

1. Copy an existing Experience
Imagine your colleagues have built an amazing chatbot experience which got your inspired to start your project. To benefit from their work, you can simply copy their experiences and work on your customizations and modifications with the copy. Click on the three dots of the chat experience you wish to copy and select "Copy Experience".
Now click " Create Experience" in the chatbot to which you want to add the experience.
Simply paste the copied link. Now you can rename your chatbot to your wishes. 

2. Create a New Experience
To build your own experience, click on "Create Experience".
Now decide whether you make use of our ready-to-go experiences or if you prefer to start from scratch. We recommend checking out the ready-to-go experiences (like Giveaway or Advent calendar) as they provide you with the logical structure of your chat flow based on your objectives.

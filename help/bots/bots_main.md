# Bots
Here you find your experiences, experience groups and bots. An experience is a single chat flow such as a Newsletter Subscription or a Giveaway use case. You can organize your experience in logical groups by copy and pasting experiences. A bot is the holistic connection of multiple experience and gives you the opportunity to create a [Home View](https://github.com/loyjoy/welcome/blob/master/documentation/introduction/HOMEVIEW.md). Access individual experiences by clicking on them and click on the bot bar at the top to access the Home View Editor. 

## How to set up your experience:

###### 1. Copy an existing Experience
Click on the three dots of the chat experience you want to copy and select "Copy experience". Now click on " Create experience" and simply paste the link. You can rename your chatbot according to your wishes. 

###### 2. Create a New Experience
To create your own experience from scratch, click on "Create experience". Now decide whether you want to use our ready-made experiences with a logical structure of a chat flow (e.g. giveaway or advent calendar) or whether you prefer to start from scratch.

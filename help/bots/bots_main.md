## How to Set up a Chatbot

In the backend, you can have several starting points. You can either start an experience by using a copy of an existing one, you can use our ready-to-use experiences that give you a process flow to customize yourself, or you can start from scratch with a blank process.

#### Option 1: Copy an existing Experience

Imagine your colleagues have built an amazing chatbot experience which got your inspired to start your project. To benefit from their work, you can simply copy their experiences and work on your customizations and modifications with the copy. Click on the three dots of the chat experience you wish to copy and select "Copy Experience".

Now click " Create Experience" in the chatbot to which you want to add the experience.

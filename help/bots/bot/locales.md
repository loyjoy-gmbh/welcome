### Translate your Language

Our chatbots run globally. However, you will launch your chatbot in a market with a specific language. To still benefit from chatbots in a different language, you can use our built-in translator. 

In the "Language" tab select your languages. 

Also, don't forget to enter your default language, which is crucial for the Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

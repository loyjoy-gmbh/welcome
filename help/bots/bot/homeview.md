You can add several different widgets, but you should start by adding a background and a logo for your navigation bar. Whenever you want to check how your changes look, just click 'Refresh Preview' and open the chat preview.
Now there are several widgets that you can add to your Home View, by clicking the plus sign of the widget of your choice.
You can drag and drop the components until they are in your preferred order.

### Hero widget

The hero widget will be a cover image with an optional greeting text field and the option to jump directly into one of your experiences.

### Icon widget

This widget shows a card with an icon, an avatar with a name and you can add labels.

### Stories widget

Provide enjoyable content by adding short animated sequences in form of stories to your Home View.
Create your stories with any AMP story tool (e.g. the free tool https://makestories.io/) and simply add the URL of your story to the story components in LoyJoy.

Back in the LoyJoy backend, you can add an avatar image and a logo for your stories.

Let your customer jump directly into one of your experiences by choosing a CTA and linking an experience to your story.

### Groups widget

Place your experiences in the Home View by using the groups widget.

Add an image and avatar image to each experience of your Home View.

### Notifications widget

This widget presents a message for the customer. Call out for action, excite your customer or guide them - all possible by using the notifications widget.

### Roster widget

The roster shows the customer's previous chats and interactions with your chat experiences.
Let your customers go back to previous conversations just like they would do while chatting with a friend.

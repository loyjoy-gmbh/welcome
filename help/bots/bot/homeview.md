### Set up the Home View

This app-like view enables you to combine multiple chatbot experiences and create a rich conversational environment.
You can add several different widgets, but you should start by adding a background and a logo for your navigation bar. Whenever you want to check how your changes look, just click 'Refresh Preview' and open the Chat Bubble.

Now there are several widgets that you can add to your Home View, by clicking the plus of the widget of your choice.
You can drag and drop the components until they are in your preferred order.

### Hero widget

The hero widget will be a cover image with an optional greeting text field. 
Introduce your customers and jump directly into one of your experiences by linking it here.

### Icon widget

This widget shows a card with icons, one avatar with name & label and below it five icons linking to processes.

### Stories widget

Through stories, you can create exciting insights for your customers. Provide enjoyable content by adding small video sequences in the form of stories to your Home View.


First, you add a new story. You can create your stories for example with the free tool https://makestories.io/ and simply add the URL of your story to the story components in LoyJoy.

Back in the LoyJoy backend, you can add an avatar image and a logo. Then choose the size of your avatar image for your stories within the Home Screen. Choose between large and compact.

Let your customer jump directly into one of your experiences by calling to action and linking an experience to your story.

### Groups widget

Place your experiences in the Home View by using the groups widget.

Add an image and avatar image to each experience of your Home View and choose a title and a slogan. 

### Notifications widget

This widget presents a message for the customer. Call out for action, excite your customer or guide them - all possible by using the notifications widget.

### Roster widget

The roster shows the customer's previous chats and interactions with your chat experiences. 
Let your customers go back to previous conversations just like they would do while chatting with a friend.

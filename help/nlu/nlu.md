# NLU

NLU stands for Natural Language Integration. We use an AI algorithm that you can train. It is an advanced technology that uses deep learning technology. The algorithm only needs "training data," which are short example sentences. So you could give example sentences of how customers would ask questions or react. The great thing is that the algorithm is self-learning, which means it generalizes based on the few examples you give to answer your customer questions or respond to customers.

# User accounts:
You can see here the existing User account. Only if you have the role ‚Owner’ you can add new Users. To add a User, e.g. if you would like to invite a colleague, you need to enter the email address, their name and their role.

# Roles 

Owner is the highest level, that you can have. We suggest that only few people have that role in your project, because they access to everything, including for example customer data. Use the other roles for the majority of the project team. The next level would be the editor. The editor has no access to the customer data, but to everything else. Editors can build the chatbots, can use the natural language processing, etc. In addition to that we have the support role: The support of course need to have access to customer data, but they can not build or edit chatbots. And the last role is viewer, which is only able to see the analytics.  This could be for example a manager, who just wants to see how the chatbots are performing.

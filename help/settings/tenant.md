# Set up your account and secure it

Make sure your LoyJoy tenant is secured by using an USB security key or the build-in finger print sensor of your computer. We recommend purchasing [FIDO2 security keys](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=FIDO2+security+keys&ref=nb_sb_noss) for your team.

Klick on 'Add security key' to add a key to your user account. From now on, you can simply login to your LoyJoy tenant without the magic link simply using the key.

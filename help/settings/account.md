# My account 

## Log in - no password needed
If you log in, you enter your email address, but you don’t have to enter your password. We did get rid of passwords, because they are insecure and forgettable and it’s just a hassle. Instead you will get an email with a magic link, which is valid for 10 minutes and if you click on it, you’re logged in to the LoyJoy platform. This is as secure as your email account is. 

## Add security key
But we strongly suggest security keys, which are even more secure. The keys cost around 20 $ and you just put them into your USB-port. Persons without this key can’t log into your platform account.

If you have a fingerprint reader on your device (e.g. your Laptop) you can also use that as a security key, but keep in mind to have 2 keys if you have to switch your device for example.

To add a USB security key or a fingerprint security key, just click on ‚Add security key‘ and select one of the possibilities.

You can see your Log-in data in the lower part, including your role in the project.

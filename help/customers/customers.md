# Customers

This is your customer database. Here you have a flexible data model, so that not only customer data, such as name and address, can be captured, but you are completely free to decide what kind of customer data you want to collect. Simply ask your customer the appropriate questions in the chat, for example, about their preferences. 

You can store this information flexibly in the customer database. You can later use this information (e.g. like product preferences) to personalize the chat or launch specific push campaigns.

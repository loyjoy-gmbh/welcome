# Customers

This is your customer database. You don’t need to store your customer data in the loyjoy platform, but it’s amazing that you have a flexible data model here. So you can not only collect customer data, like name and address, but you can completely decide what kind of customer data you would like to collect then ask your customer the corresponding question in the chat e.g. for their preferences. 

You can store that information flexibly in the customer database. You can use that information (for example like product preferences) later to personalize the chat experience.

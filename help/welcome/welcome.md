## How to Log in

After your first call with the LoyJoy team, you will receive an email invitation by LoyJoy. Please confirm your account within 24 hours to activate your account.

To access the LoyJoy backend, simply enter your email address to access your tenant on [cloud.loyjoy.com](http://cloud.loyjoy.com/).

Everybody has troubles remembering passwords. That's why we retire the password for good. Each time you log in to the LoyJoy platform, we will send you a magic link via email. Click the link in the email to access the platform.

To secure your account, we recommend using a [security key](https://cloud.loyjoy.com/manager/settings) or the build-in fingerprint sensor of your laptop. This is also the fastest way to log in to the LoyJoy backend.

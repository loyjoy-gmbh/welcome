# Start with home view

Welcome to the LoyJoy Conversation Marketing Cloud!
This article will guide you through the features of home view. Home view is a start page for various chatbots or stories. From here you can easily navigate to your
different experiences. You can also create and add stories. 
Home view has added value for you because you can create different chatbots on different topics and find them on one page without your customers visiting every page
of your homepage.

You can also provide your customers with short videos and pictures by adding stories. This promises more proximity to your customers!

To start with Home view, click on the Home view button. Make sure that you are in the right bot. In our example, we build a home view about the bicycle. We have
already created two experiences that we will use in the home view.

Now there are several widgets that you can add to your home view. 
To do so, click on the plus of the widget of your choice.

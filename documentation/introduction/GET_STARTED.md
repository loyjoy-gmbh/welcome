</p>

Now it's up to you whether you want to create a new experience or modify an existing one.
To discover the existing experience you need to click on the bar.

<p align="center">
  <img src="which_bot.png" alt="Choose a bot" title="Choose a bot" width="300"/>
</p>

As you want to start you have different options: You can create your personal experience or you copy an existing experience and change or test it. 

#### Copy an existing experience

If there is already an experience that you like or that you want to change, you can copy it. This way you can change it as you like and the other experience remains the same. 
To copy the experience of your choice, you must click on the three dots. Then choose "copy experience". 

<p align="center">
  <img src="copy_experience.png" alt="Copy an existing experience" title="Copy an existing experience" width="500"/>
</p>

Then copy the link.

<p align="center">
  <img src="copy_link.png" alt="copy link of existing experience" title="copy link of existing experience" width="500"/>
</p>

Afterward, you have to scroll down and click on "create experience". 

<p align="center">
  <img src="create_experience.png" alt="Create experience" title="Create experience" width="300"/>
</p>

Again, scroll down and then paste the copied link. Finally, click on "Paste experience". Immediately you have your own experience. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="paste_experience.png" alt="Paste experience" title="Paste experience" width="600"/>
</p>

Give the copy a new name so you know which version is the new one.

<p align="center">
  <img src="name_experience.png" alt="Give experience name" title="Give experience name" width="400"/>
</p>

Now you have done it and can start with your copied experience.

#### Create a new experience

To create your own experience, you must first click on "create experience".

<p align="center">
  <img src="create_experience.png" alt="Create new experience" title="create new experience" width="300"/>
</p>

 Then you have to decide whether you want to create an experience all by yourself or whether you want to work with an example. 

<p align="left">
  <img src="custom_experience.png" alt="Custom experience" title="Custom experience" width="400"/>
 <img src="pick_experience.png" alt="Pick a ready-to-use experience" title="Pick a ready-to-use experience" width="500"/>
</p>

Once you have chosen a template, click on "start now" at the experience of your choice. When you have decided to start over, click on "Custom experience".

You did it! Now you can start!

#### New experience

Now we are diving right into the process editor. 
Here you can choose how your flow should look like. On the left side, you can see all the process blocks (Link Process Bricks)
that are available to you. On the right side, you can see how your current flow looks like.

<p align="center">
  <img src="process_editor.png" alt="Process editor" title="Process editor" width="500"/>
</p>

First, you choose which building block you would like to have in your flow. You then drag it to the right side.

<p align="center">
  <img src="add_to_editor.gif" alt="Add bricks to editor" title="Add bricks to editor" width="500"/>
</p>

If you have made a mistake, you can simply drag it back again.

<p align="center">
  <img src="remove_from_editor.gif" alt="Remove from editor" title="Remove from editor" width="500"/>
</p>

Even a wrong order is no problem. If you want to swap individual building blocks, simply drag them into the correct order. Don't worry, texts that you have already inserted will remain.

<p align="center">
  <img src="change_edit_order.gif" alt="Change order of editor" title="Change order of editor" width="100"/>
</p>

Once you have added a process block, you can edit it. To do this, you click on "Close process editor". 

<p align="center">
  <img src="close_editor.png" alt="CLose process editor" title="Close process editor" width="500"/>
</p>

Now you can enter whatever you want in the text fields. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="choose_message.png" alt="Choose message" title="Choose message" width="500"/>
</p>

If you want to add links, smileys, or variables you have to click on the small button at the end of the text field. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="links_smileys_variables.png" alt="Add links, smileys or variables" title="Add links, smileys or variables" width="500"/>
</p>

With the first button, you can add links. With the button, you get a template that you have to fill in. In the square brackets is the text that will be displayed by the chatbot. In the round brackets, the link is placed. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="explanation_link.png" alt="Explanation link" title="Explanation link" width="500"/>
</p>

You will not see this link afterward.

<p align="left">
  <img src="link_example.png" alt="Example of using links" title="Example of using links" width="500"/>
  <img src="link_example_flow.png" alt="Example of using links" title="Example of using links" width="400"/>
</p>

With the second button you can select smileys. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="explain_smileys.png" alt="Use of smileys" title="Use of smileys" width="400"/>
</p>

> If you click on the last button you can add variables. If, for example, a customer has already entered his or her name, it can be used in the greeting

<p align="center">
  <img src="explain_variables.png" alt="Explain variables" title="Explain variables" width="500"/>
</p>

To make your flow clearer, you should give the individual building blocks appropriate names. This is especially helpful in the Process editor, because there you don't see the contents, but only the names. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="name_bricks.png" alt="Give bricks a name" title="Give bricks a name" width="300"/>
</p>

If after a while you want to see how your chatbot looks like now and if it works, click on refresh preview. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="refresh_preview.png" alt="Refresh preview" title="Refresh preivew" width="400"/>
</p>

Then click on the button in the bottom corner.

<p align="center">
  <img src="button.png" alt="Chatbutton" title="Chatbutton" width="200"/>
</p>

 This opens your chatbot. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="first_flow.png" alt="First flow example" title="First flow example" width="300"/>
</p>

Every time you change something and want to see the chatbot afterward, you have to click on refresh preview. If you don't do this, you will always see the old version. 

The chatbot saves automatically! There is no action needed.

### How to adjust the branding

Make your chatbot special by giving it your individual style.
You can give the chat your own name, attract customers with a slogan, and choose a placeholder for the chat input field. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="branding_header.png" alt="Branding Header" title="Branding Header" width="500"/>
</p>

Here are some examples:

<p align="center">
  <img src="branding_examples.png" alt="Examples for branding" title="Example for branding" width="500"/>
</p>

After that, you can add your own logo. 

<p align="left">
  <img src="upload_logo.png" alt="Upload logo" title="Upload logo" width="300"/>
  <img src="branding_example_logo.png" alt="Example logo" title="Example logo" width="300"/>
</p>

You can also choose the color for the notifications. Choose one that you like or that fits your company.

<p align="left">
  <img src="change_colour.png" alt="Change colour" title="Change colour" width="400"/>
  <img src="colour_change_example.png" alt="Example change of colour" title="Example change of colour" width="300"/>
</p>

If you wish so, you can use your own CSS template. Please contact the LoyJoy team for further information.

<p align="center">
  <img src="css_template.png" alt="CSS template" title="CSS template" width="500"/>
</p>

An email address must be provided so that feedback etc. from the customer can be forwarded to you.

<p align="center">
  <img src="branding_email.png" alt="email" title="email" width="500"/>
</p>

For chatbot content where the date is relevant (birthdays, time, etc.), the correct time zone must be set 

<p align="center">
  <img src="timezone.png" alt="Customer timezone" title="Customer timezone" width="500"/>
</p>

Before a chatbot goes live, an imprint must be added.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imprint.png" alt="imprint" title="Imprint" width="400"/>
</p>

If you want to email through Loyjoy with your own domain, you must fill out this form. 
Contact the LoyJoy Team beforehand

<p align="center">
  <img src="configure_outgoing_emails.png" alt="Configure outgoing emails" title="Configure outgoing emails" width="500"/>
</p>

There are some phrases to which the chatbot automatically has an answer. But if the customer types something that the bot has no answer to, you can set the automatic answer here.
It is also possible to have the customer fill out a contact form so that the questions can be answered personally. (Link to NLU)

<p align="center">
  <img src="reaction_unrecognised_intents.png" alt="Reaction to unrecognised intents" title="Reaction to unrecognised intents" width="500"/>
</p>

Offer persistent quick replies on the bottom of the chat. Your customers can use these to jump into another experience or to a process brick.

<p align="center">
  <img src="persistent_quick_replies.png" alt="Persistent quick replies" title="Persistent quick replies" width="300"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="persistent_click_example.png" alt="Persistent quick replies example" title="Persistent quick replies example" width="300"/>
</p>

### How to go live

You are done with your chatbot and want to show it to your colleagues? Or you want to customize other things outside the flow? Or you are finished and want to publish the chatbot? You are right under the tab "Publish".

<p align="center">
  <img src="publish_first_page.png" alt="First page publish" title="First page publish" width="500"/>
</p>

By clicking on "Open landing page" you can view the chatbot on a landing page. You can also share the link and make it available to your colleagues. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="share_landing_page.png" alt="Share landing page" title="Share landing page" width="500"/>
</p>

Our example could look like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="example_landing_page.png" alt="Example for landing page" title="Example for landing page" width="400"/>
</p>

You also can view the chatbot on your smartphone. Just scan the QR code.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="view_on_mobile.png" alt="Test version mobile" title="Test version mobile" width="400"/>
</p>

If you enter the URL of your homepage here, you will see the bot already there.

<p align="center">
  <img src="test_on_website.png" alt="Test version website" title="Test version website" width="500"/>
</p>

When the chatbot is completely finished and you want to add it to the code of your website, you can find the corresponding HTML codes here. 
All three codes must be used.

<p align="center">
  <img src="html_website.png" alt="HTML Website" title="HTML Website" width="300"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="html_chat_script.png" alt="HTML Chat" title="HTML Chat" width="300"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="html_button_script.png" alt="HTML Button" title="HTML Button" width="300"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="html_button_button.png" alt="HTML Button" title="HTML Button" width="300"/>
</p>

The chatbot can be used not only on one website but also on various social media channels. 
To use the chatbot on Instagram, use this link:

<p align="center">
  <img src="instagram.png" alt="Instagram" title="Instagram" width="400"/>
</p>

For all other channels contact the LoyJoy Team.

<p align="center">
  <img src="social_media.png" alt="Social Media" title="Social Media" width="500"/>
</p>

You have different settings for the chat window and the chat bubble. Here you can see our standard settings:

<p align="center">
  <img src="standard_settings.png" alt="Standard settings" title="Standard settings" width="500"/>
</p>

You might have noticed in the example that the landing page and the chat bubble is adapted to LoyJoy. You can also do this for your company. Here you can insert a logo, which will be used as a chat bubble:

<p align="center">
  <img src="image_chat_bubble.png" alt="Chat bubble" title="Chat bubble" width="400"/>
</p>

The image that you insert here will be your landing page:

<p align="center">
  <img src="add_landing_page.png" alt="Add landing page" title="Add landing page" width="400"/>
</p>

It is also up to you if and how the chat bubble should be animated. These are the different possibilities you have:

<p align="center">
  <img src="animation.gif" alt="Animation" title="Animation" width="500"/>

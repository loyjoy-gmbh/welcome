## How to set up a chatbot

In the backend you can have several starting points. You can either start an experience by using a copy of an existing one, you can use our ready-to-use experiences that give you a process flow to customize yourself, or you can start from scratch with a blank process.

<p align="center">

</p>


#### Option 1: Copy an existing experience

Imagine your colleagues have built an amazing chatbot experience which got your inspired to start your own project. To benefit from their work, you can simply copy their experiences and work on your customizations and modifications with the copy. Click on the three dots of the chat experience you wish to copy and select "Copy Experience".

</p>

Now click " Create Experience" in the chatbot to which you want to add the experience.

#### The Chat Flow Editor

Let's dive right into the Process Editor, the heart of every chat flow. On the left side, you can find [all process blocks](https://github.com/loyjoy/welcome/blob/master/documentation/process_building_blocks/PROCESS_BUILDING_BLOCKS.md) to use for your chat flow. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="process_editor.png" alt="Process editor" title="Process editor" width="500"/>
</p>

Simply drag and drop the process blocks into your flow.

<p align="center">

</p>

Once you have added all your process blocks, the next step would be editing. Click "Close process editor" to open the Chat Flow Editor.

<p align="center">
  <img src="editor_close.png" alt="Close process editor" title="Close process editor" width="500"/>
</p>

Feel free to insert your prefered text into the text fields. Click on each process block to edit its texts.

<p align="center">
  <img src="choose_message.png" alt="Choose message" title="Choose message" width="500"/>
</p>

To add hyperlinks, emojis and variables to your texts, click on the small button at the end of each text field. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="links_smileys_variables.png" alt="Add links, smileys or variables" title="Add links, smileys or variables" width="500"/>
</p>

Adding a hyperlink to your text will require a link text (in square brackets) and an URL link (in round brackets).

<p align="center">

</p>

This is how a hyper link looks like for the user.

<p align="center">
  <img src="link_example_flow.png" alt="Example of using links" title="Example of using links" width="300"/>
</p>

Select exciting emoticons to engage emotionally with your consumers. Take advantage of our selection, where all emoticons are checked for aesthetics on all operating systems. But you are not limited - Insert any emoji by simply pasting it into the text field.

<p align="center">
  <img src="explain_smileys.png" alt="Use of smileys" title="Use of smileys" width="500"/>
</p>

Add variables to individualize your texts for every customer. Address them by their first name when returning to your chatbot, provide content specific data or link variable data to your text field. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="explain_variables.png" alt="Explain variables" title="Explain variables" width="500"/>
</p>

To make sure you stay on top of your chat flow, you can name your process blocks according to their use. This helps you to nativcate through your flow when complexity grows.

<p align="center">
  <img src="name_bricks.png" alt="Give bricks a name" title="Give bricks a name" width="300"/>

<p align="center">

## How to adjust the Branding

</p>

An email address must be set to address customer inquiries.

<p align="center">
  <img src="branding_email.png" alt="email" title="email" width="300"/>
</p>

Before a chatbot goes live, an imprint must be set.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imprint.png" alt="imprint" title="Imprint" width="300"/>
</p>

If you are sending emails through your own mail domain, please fill out the following fields. Ask your LoyJoy Success Manager for assistance.

<p align="center">

</p>

Some consumers will type something into the open text field at the bottom of the chatbot. In order to respond to customer input, we provide standard intents to respond empathically to customer inquiries. However, in some cases, our AI algorithm will not identify the input. Define a message to send out to your customers in that case or let them fill out a contact form so that the inquiry can be addressed personally.

  <img src="reaction_unrecognised_intents.png" alt="Reaction to unrecognised intents" title="Reaction to unrecognised intents" width="500"/>
</p>

</p>

Now it's up to you whether you want to create a new experience or modify an existing one.
To discover the existing experience you need to click on the bar.

<p align="center">
  <img src="which_bot.png" alt="Choose a bot" title="Choose a bot" width="300"/>
</p>

As you want to start you have different options: You can create your personal experience or you copy an existing experience and change or test it. 

#### Copy an existing experience

If there is already an experience that you like or that you want to change, you can copy it. This way you can change it as you like and the other experience remains the same. 
To copy the experience of your choice, you must click on the three dots. Then choose "copy experience". 

<p align="center">
  <img src="copy_experience.png" alt="Copy an existing experience" title="Copy an existing experience" width="500"/>
</p>

Then copy the link.

<p align="center">
  <img src="copy_link.png" alt="copy link of existing experience" title="copy link of existing experience" width="500"/>
</p>

Afterward, you have to scroll down and click on "create experience". 

<p align="center">
  <img src="create_experience.png" alt="Create experience" title="Create experience" width="300"/>
</p>

Again, scroll down and then paste the copied link. Finally, click on "Paste experience". Immediately you have your own experience. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="paste_experience.png" alt="Paste experience" title="Paste experience" width="600"/>
</p>

Give the copy a new name so you know which version is the new one.

<p align="center">
  <img src="name_experience.png" alt="Give experience name" title="Give experience name" width="400"/>
</p>

Now you have done it and can start with your copied experience.

#### Create a new experience

To create your own experience, you must first click on "create experience".

<p align="center">
  <img src="create_experience.png" alt="Create new experience" title="create new experience" width="300"/>
</p>

 Then you have to decide whether you want to create an experience all by yourself or whether you want to work with an example. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="custom_experience.png" alt="Custom experience" title="Custom experience" width="400"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="pick_experience.png" alt="Pick a ready-to-use experience" title="Pick a ready-to-use experience" width="500"/>
</p>

Once you have chosen a template, click on "start now" at the experience of your choice. When you have decided to start over, click on "Custom experience".

You did it! Now you can start!

#### New experience

Now we are diving right into the process editor. 
Here you can choose how your flow should look like. On the left side, you can see all the process blocks (Link Process Bricks)
that are available to you. On the right side, you can see how your current flow looks like.

<p align="center">
  <img src="process_editor.png" alt="Process editor" title="Process editor" width="500"/>
</p>

First, you choose which building block you would like to have in your flow. You then drag it to the right side.

<p align="center">
  <img src="add_to_editor.gif" alt="Add bricks to editor" title="Add bricks to editor" width="500"/>
</p>

If you have made a mistake, you can simply drag it back again.

<p align="center">
  <img src="remove_from_editor.gif" alt="Remove from editor" title="Remove from editor" width="500"/>
</p>

Even a wrong order is no problem. If you want to swap individual building blocks, simply drag them into the correct order. Don't worry, texts that you have already inserted will remain.

<p align="center">
  <img src="change_edit_order.gif" alt="Change order of editor" title="Change order of editor" width="200"/>
</p>

Once you have added a process block, you can edit it. To do this, you click on "Close process editor". 

<p align="center">
  <img src="close_editor.png" alt="CLose process editor" title="Close process editor" width="300"/>
</p>

Now you can enter whatever you want in the text fields. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="choose_message.png" alt="Choose message" title="Choose message" width="300"/>
</p>

If you want to add links, smileys, or variables you have to click on the small button at the end of the text field. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="links_smileys_variables.png" alt="Add links, smileys or variables" title="Add links, smileys or variables" width="300"/>
</p>

With the first button, you can add links. With the button, you get a template that you have to fill in. In the square brackets is the text that will be displayed by the chatbot. In the round brackets, the link is placed. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="explanation_link.png" alt="Explanation link" title="Explanation link" width="300"/>
</p>

You will not see this link afterward.

<p align="center">
  <img src="link_example.png" alt="Example of using links" title="Example of using links" width="300"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="link_example_flow.png" alt="Example of using links" title="Example of using links" width="300"/>
</p>

With the second button you can select smileys. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="explain_smileys.png" alt="Use of smileys" title="Use of smileys" width="300"/>
</p>

> If you click on the last button you can add variables. If, for example, a customer has already entered his or her name, it can be used in the greeting

<p align="center">
  <img src="explain_variables.png" alt="Explain variables" title="Explain variables" width="300"/>
</p>

To make your flow clearer, you should give the individual building blocks appropriate names. This is especially helpful in the Process editor, because there you don't see the contents, but only the names. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="name_bricks.png" alt="Give bricks a name" title="Give bricks a name" width="300"/>
</p>

If after a while you want to see how your chatbot looks like now and if it works, click on refresh preview. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="refresh_preview.png" alt="Refresh preview" title="Refresh preivew" width="300"/>
</p>

Then click on the button in the bottom corner.

<p align="center">
  <img src="button.png" alt="Chatbutton" title="Chatbutton" width="300"/>
</p>

 This opens your chatbot. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="first_flow.png" alt="First flow example" title="First flow example" width="300"/>
</p>

Every time you change something and want to see the chatbot afterward, you have to click on refresh preview. If you don't do this, you will always see the old version. 

The chatbot saves automatically! There is no action needed.
